# Heart-Disease-Prediction
A machine learning-powered web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user input parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other clinical features.
Built using Streamlit for an interactive frontend and trained on a publicly available heart disease dataset, the model assists in early risk assessment and awareness.
